# CCBD_Polygon-Generator
This project aims to generate random polygon ranging from 10 to 500 vertices with base polygons ranging from triangle to octagon. The polygons are saved in a wkt format in a .csv file. The polygon is later used to generate a Voronoi map which represents spatial bodies in real-time maps. The image of the map is processed to find the distribution of these spatial bodies on the map using PI chart
