# CCBD_Polygon-Generator
This project aims to generate random polygon ranging from 10 to 500 vertices with base polygons ranging from triangle to octagon. The polygons are saved in a wkt format in a .csv file.  
The time taken to generate the file and the size of file is

The polygons generated in the .csv file are visualised using QGIS, an open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system application.

The polygon is later used to generate a Voronoi map which represents spatial bodies in real-time maps.

The image of the map is processed to find the distribution of these spatial bodies on the map using PI chart
